# Loop state — lane-loop
session_started: 2026-06-13 (UTC date; scripts can't read the clock)
loop: lane-loop
branch: main (features shipped via per-feature worktrees+PRs; auto-merge on green)
worktree: (this session ran from ~/Desktop/meta/lane + per-item worktrees under ../.worktrees/)
cycle_budget: 3            # completed cycles per session before handoff (override via RALPH_BUDGET)
cycles_this_session: 3     # multi-hop, webpolicy, lane web seam
cycles_total: 17           # carried across sessions (slim parity + --json + Phase-7 + Phase-8 seam)
last_item: PHASE A1 COMPLETE (obscura estate integration) — followed the "next 5 tasks" session.
        Merged: obscura #2 (RED→GREEN baseline 271/0), #3 (custom-CA trust), #4 (fork identity→FlexNetOS);
        lane #42 (lane-web seam reconciled to obscura's real CLI); network_hub #1 (obscura registered +
        Rust-native validator). meta #35 (.meta.yaml triage) armed but blocked by unrelated meta-main
        Format failure. A1-5 MCP verified via obscura's mcp_client e2e suite. See phase-a1-obscura.md.
status: ACTIVE — Phase A1 done. NEXT (owner sequence 1→4→3, step 3): return to lane → lane DONE-gate.
        Earlier this session: "next 5 tasks" delivered (option 1) — Phase-7 Round B 6/6 (multi-hop #38)
        + Phase-8 lane web seam mechanism (webpolicy #39, web seam #40, ADR-0001 ratified).
        - Product altitude: slim parity + full --json (#15-#25); Phase-7 Round A (#26/#27);
          Round B 6/6 (#32-#36, #38). 351 tests green default / 350 with --features obscura;
          clippy clean both, fmt clean.
        - Fleet altitude: lane = network plane (Tier B). North-star = "lane owns network
          engineering/control; obscura upgrades it with stealth agent web access". docs/VISION.md.
        - Phase-8 seam: ADR-0001 RATIFIED (Option B). `lane web` mechanism SHIPPED feature-gated
          (`obscura = []`), fail-closed. webpolicy (deny-by-default SSRF gate) + src/web/ (pure
          plan/authorize + #[cfg(feature)] live spawn) + CLI + config. NO new dep; live obscura
          child-spawn + daemon/MCP `lane_web` op DEFERRED to Phase A1 (obscura integration).
        - NEXT (owner sequence: 1→4→3): (4) PIVOT to Phase A1 = obscura estate integration in the
          SEPARATE repo FlexNetOS/obscura (the real gate that un-gates the live `lane web` path),
          then (3) DONE-gate lane. Remaining lane Phase-8 items (lane relay, network_hub registry)
          stay owner-gated (each needs its own ADR).
