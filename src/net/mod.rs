//! lane's **host network plane** (ADR-0003 — adopt-consume the host network).
//!
//! ADR-0003 makes lane the named owner of the host's *base* network
//! configuration — interfaces, addresses, routes, link-local special cases —
//! today owned per-box by `NetworkManager`/`netplan` files in `/etc`, which do
//! not travel with the repo (so the estate is not portable). lane **adopts** that
//! host state into a Rust-native, declarative model and **consumes** it (diff,
//! render, reconcile) so a box is reproducible from the repo.
//!
//! # What is always compiled (and tested)
//!
//! - [`model`] — the pure serde data model for the host plane. It is a **lossless
//!   superset of netplan v2** (per the ADR's no-downgrade contract): every
//!   observable in a host snapshot — address, route, match rule, never-default,
//!   autoconnect, wifi key-mgmt, link-local mode — round-trips adopt→render
//!   unchanged. The model carries no host access, so it compiles and its
//!   round-trip tests run in the default build (no feature gate), mirroring how
//!   [`crate::relay::allowlist`] keeps its pure security core always-built.
//! - [`profile`] (P2) — in-repo per-host profiles: the pure `hosts/<name>.yaml`
//!   read/write/list + runtime-unit strip is always built; only the live-host
//!   *save* (which adopts) is gated. The "meta is portable" payoff.
//! - [`networkd`] (P2) — the systemd-networkd render backend for non-NM boxes: the
//!   pure model → `.network`/`.netdev`/`.link` render is always built and
//!   fixture-tested; only the file-writing apply path is gated.
//!
//! # What is feature-gated
//!
//! Only the *effectful* paths take the `hostnet` gate: the live host reader in
//! [`adopt`] (`nmcli`) and the host-mutating apply step in [`apply`]
//! ([`apply::apply_plan`], `nmcli`). The [`adopt`] and [`apply`] modules are
//! themselves always compiled — [`adopt::parse_nmcli_connection`] (the text parser)
//! and [`apply::reconcile`] (the additive diff planner) are built and tested in
//! every build; only the thin `nmcli`-spawning wrappers carry the gate. This is the
//! "pure layer always built, effectful path gated" precedent the relay module
//! established.
